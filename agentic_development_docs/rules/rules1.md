I have not decided the project name fully. Let's call it namesmith for now - keep all variable names as namesmith when required. When text are to be dispayed, use a global variable with "Namesmith" for now - such that if I want to update it in the future in one place, that is possible.

Don't modify the code inside old_code folder. old_code folder is the earlier implementation.

Use the latest most stable version of the softwares and tools. Don't be forced to use the version used in old_code folder implementation. That implementation is 1 year back, and can contain older version of softwares and tools.

Use pnpm as Node package manager. Use uv for python.

follow frontend rules from 5_frontend_design.md
